Complete the following source code to plot x ↦ y as a line graph:

* The x-axis should be labeled Time (years)
* The y-axis should be labeled Fraction Remaining
* The title should be Exponential Decay of C-14
* The y-axis should be logarithmically scaled
* The x-axis should range from 0 to 28650

### 3. Two is better than one
Complete the following source code to plot x ↦ y1 and x ↦ y2 as line graphs:

* The x-axis should be labeled Time (years)
* The y-axis should be labeled Fraction Remaining
* The title should be Exponential Decay of Radioactive Elements
* The x-axis should range from 0 to 20,000
* The y-axis should range from 0 to 1
* x ↦ y1 should be plotted with a dashed red line
* x ↦ y2 should be plotted with a solid green line
* A legend labeling x ↦ y1 as C-14 and x ↦ y2 as Ra-226 should be placed in the upper right hand corner of the plot

### 4. Frequency
Complete the following source code to plot a histogram of student scores for a project:

* The x-axis should be labeled Grades
* The y-axis should be labeled Number of Students
* The x-axis should have bins every 10 units
* The title should be Project A
* The bars should be outlined in black

### 5. All in One
Complete the following source code to plot all 5 previous graphs in one figure:

* All axis labels and plot titles should have a font size of x-small (to fit nicely in one figure)
* The plots should make a 3 x 2 grid
* The last plot should take up two column widths (see below)
* The title of the figure should be All in One

### 6. Stacking Bars
Complete the following source code to plot a stacked bar graph:

* fruit is a matrix representing the number of fruit various people possess
    * The columns of fruit represent the number of fruit Farrah, Fred, and Felicia have, respectively
    * The rows of fruit represent the number of apples, bananas, oranges, and peaches, respectively
* The bars should represent the number of fruit each person possesses:
    * The bars should be grouped by person, i.e, the horizontal axis should have one labeled tick per person
    * Each fruit should be represented by a specific color:
        * apples = red
        * bananas = yellow
        * oranges = orange (#ff8000)
        * peaches = peach (#ffe5b4)
        * A legend should be used to indicate which fruit is represented by each color
     * The bars should be stacked in the same order as the rows of fruit, from bottom to top
     * The bars should have a width of 0.5
* The y-axis should be labeled Quantity of Fruit
* The y-axis should range from 0 to 80 with ticks every 10 units
* The title should be Number of Fruit per Person

### 7. Gradient
Complete the following source code to create a scatter plot of sampled elevations on a mountain:

* The x-axis should be labeled x coordinate (m)
* The y-axis should be labeled y coordinate (m)
* The title should be Mountain Elevation
* A colorbar should be used to display elevation
* The colorbar should be labeled elevation (m)
