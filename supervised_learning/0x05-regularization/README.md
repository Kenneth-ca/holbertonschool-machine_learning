# 0x05. Regularization

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is regularization? What is its purpose?
* What is are L1 and L2 regularization? What is the difference between the two
 methods?
* What is dropout?
* What is early stopping?
* What is data augmentation?
* How do you implement the above regularization methods in Numpy? Tensorflow?
* What are the pros and cons of the above regularization methods?
