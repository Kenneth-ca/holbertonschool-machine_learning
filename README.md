*“Nobody phrases it this way, but I think that artificial intelligence is
almost a humanities discipline. It's really an attempt to understand human
intelligence and human cognition.”* —Sebastian Thrun

### About me 🌐
Economist who likes coding and do Machine Learning stuff.
I love the sea, reading books and listen to music.
